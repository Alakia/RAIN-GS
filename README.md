## Introduction
![](assets/teaser.png)<br>
We introduce a novel optimization strategy **RAIN-GS** for 3D Gaussian Splatting!

We show that our simple yet effective strategy consisted of **sparse-large-variance (SLV) random initialization** and **progressive Gaussian low-pass filter control** robustly guides 3D Gaussians to model the scene even when starting from random point clouds.

For further details and visualization results, please check out our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/) and our [project page](https://ku-cvlab.github.io/RAIN-GS/).

## Installation
We implement **RAIN-GS** above the official implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting. <br> For environmental setup, we kindly guide you to follow the original requirements of [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting). 

## Training

To train 3D Gaussian Splatting with our novel strategy (**RAIN-GS**), all you need to do is:

```

```
